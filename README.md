# Flow Outliner

Outliner experience for Obsidian, inspired by RemNote, Roam Research and Logseq. Early scaffolding: no user-facing features yet.

## Development

Requires Node.js 22.12 or newer.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run check
```

| Script                  | Purpose                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`           | Watch build to `main.js`                           |
| `npm run build`         | Typecheck and production bundle                    |
| `npm run check`         | Typecheck, lint, format check, tests with coverage |
| `npm run test:mutation` | Mutation testing with Stryker                      |
| `npm run format`        | Format with Prettier                               |

Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` into `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/flow-outliner/` to try it in Obsidian.

## Releasing new releases

- Update your `manifest.json` with your new version number, such as `1.0.1`, and the minimum Obsidian version required for your latest release.
- Update your `versions.json` file with `"new-plugin-version": "minimum-obsidian-version"` so older versions of Obsidian can download an older version of your plugin that's compatible.
- Create new GitHub release using your new version number as the "Tag version". Use the exact version number, don't include a prefix `v`. See here for an example: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin/releases
- Upload the files `manifest.json`, `main.js`, `styles.css` as binary attachments. Note: The manifest.json file must be in two places, first the root path of your repository and also in the release.
- Publish the release.

> You can simplify the version bump process by running `npm version patch`, `npm version minor` or `npm version major` after updating `minAppVersion` manually in `manifest.json`.
> The command will bump version in `manifest.json` and `package.json`, and add the entry for the new version to `versions.json`

## Adding your plugin to the community plugin list

- Check the [plugin guidelines](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Plugin+guidelines).
- Publish an initial version.
- Make sure you have a `README.md` file in the root of your repo.
- Make a pull request at https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases to add your plugin.

## How to use

- Clone this repo.
- Make sure your NodeJS is at least v18 (`node --version`).
- `npm i` to install dependencies.
- `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

## Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.

## Improve code quality with eslint

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool that analyzes your code to quickly find problems. You can run ESLint against your plugin to find common bugs and ways to improve your code.
- This project already has eslint preconfigured, you can invoke a check by running`npm run lint`
- Together with a custom eslint [plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/eslint-plugin) for Obsidan specific code guidelines.
- A GitHub action is preconfigured to automatically lint every commit on all branches.

## Funding URL

You can include funding URLs where people who use your plugin can financially support it.

The simple way is to set the `fundingUrl` field to your link in your `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
	"fundingUrl": "https://buymeacoffee.com"
}
```

If you have multiple URLs, you can also do:

```json
{
	"fundingUrl": {
		"Buy Me a Coffee": "https://buymeacoffee.com",
		"GitHub Sponsor": "https://github.com/sponsors",
		"Patreon": "https://www.patreon.com/"
	}
}
```
